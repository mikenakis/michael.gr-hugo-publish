<a href=/post/2021-10-so-what-is-microservice-anyway/>So, what is a Microservice, anyway?</a>) I examine what a microservice really is, and I come to the conclusion that from a purely technical standpoint, a working definition could be
as simple as this:</p><p>A microservice is a scalable and resilient module.</p><p>Even if you disagree with the terseness of this definition, and you regard
microservices as necessarily more than that, I hope you will at least agree
that it is precisely scalability and resilience that statelessness in microservices aims to address, so this definition serves its
purpose at least in the context of this series of posts.</p><p>There are many who will try to convince you that in order to build a scalable
and resilient system, you need statelessness; so much so, that microservices
have almost come to be regarded as synonymous with statelessness. This post
examines whether this is that in fact so, and what is the cost of doing things
this way.</p><p>(Useful pre-reading: <a href=/post/2022-11-about-these-papers/>About these papers</a>)</p><p>If we take a step back for a moment and examine the issue from a somewhat
distanced point of view, we notice that there is no such thing as a stateless
software system. If there was such a thing, it would not be capable of
performing any function worth speaking of, and it would necessarily be less
useful than a brick, because a brick has physical existence, so you can, at
the very least, throw it at someone.</p><p>If there is one thing that a software system necessarily has, it is state, so
there is no word that is more unsuitable to go with the word "software" than
the word "stateless". (By the way, that is also a little something that
functional programming aficionados should perhaps take a moment to
philosophically ponder about.)</p><p>What this all means is that even if you build a system using so-called
stateless microservices, that system will still have state; for example, if it
is a web shop, it will very conveniently remember me when I come to visit
again, and if I order any goods during my visit, it will very inconveniently
<em>not</em> forget to send me an invoice. That is all happening due to state, which is
stored in the database system of the web shop. So, when people speak of
microservices with no state what they actually mean is microservices with no
<em>transient</em> state. The state is definitely there, the system just does
not rely on any microservice remembering any of it. Each microservice
refrains from keeping any state in memory for any longer than it absolutely
has to; it always begins the processing of every single transaction by
querying the database for all necessary state, and it makes sure to persist
any changed state into the database before proclaiming the transaction
complete.</p><p>Stateless microservices were invented because statelessness is an easy way of
achieving scalability and resilience: if a module does not keep any state, then an
indefinite number of copies of that module can be created to process requests in
parallel; any request arriving at the server farm can be serviced by any
instance of that module, and any subset of copies of the module can be destroyed at any moment,
without depriving the system from its ability to function.</p><p>That's great, but statelessness is not an end in and of itself; it is a means
to an end; it is just one way of achieving scalability and
resilience. This is proven by the fact that the database systems upon which
stateless microservice architectures are built are most certainly not
stateless at all, and yet they do somehow manage to be scalable and resilient.
Obviously, they are doing something differently.</p><h4 id=what-is-wrong-with-statelessness>What is wrong with statelessness?</h4><p>When building a system which needs to be scalable and resilient, and also
needs to be very stateful as a whole, one has to begin with a scalable and
resilient data layer as a foundation. Luckily, there exist various
commercially available products that accomplish this. On top of that
foundation, one has to build their application-specific logic in a way that is
also scalable and resilient. Stateless microservices will achieve this, but
they are one of the <strong>worst performing</strong>, and from an engineering
standpoint most <em><strong>cowardly</strong></em> ways of achieving scalability and
resilience. Choosing the stateless microservices approach is like saying the
following:</p><blockquote><p>State is hard; we do not have the slightest clue as to how we can maintain
state and at the same time remain scalable and resilient; but look, the
creators of our database system are very smart folks, they seem to have
figured it all out! So, here is what we will do: we will delegate the entire
task of maintaining state to them!</p></blockquote><p>That is how we arrived at the stateless microservice model, which I like to
call the "Dory" model, after the fish that suffered from amnesia in the
<em>Finding Nemo</em> movie.</p><p>In the Dory model, every single incoming transaction gets processed by a
microservice that is drawing a complete blank. Upon receiving the request, the
microservice starts with very basic questions:</p><ul><li><p>Who am I, and what is this strange place I am running in?</p></li><li><p>Who are these folks sending me requests, and why?</p></li><li><p>Should I respond to them, or should I four-oh-three them away?</p></li><li><p>Let's start by authenticating them...</p><p>...and it goes on like that. For every single request, there are multiple
round-trips to the database while the microservice is discovering more and more
about what it is being requested to do and whether it should in fact do it,
and even more round-trips to retrieve the information that will go into the
response, including very basic information that hardly ever changes, such as
the name of the visitor on whose behalf the request was sent, and in multi-tenancy scenarios even
the name of the tenant on whose behalf the website is being served.</p><p>When the transaction is nearing completion, the stateless microservice will
meticulously store every single little piece of changed state in its exact
right place in the database, as if it is making notes to itself, lest it
forgets.</p><p>Finally, once the transaction is completed, the microservice will proceed to
deliberately forget absolutely everything that it learned during the
processing of the transaction, before it starts to wait for the next
transaction.</p><p>I am not going to say that this is preposterously inefficient, but
it is <em><strong>preposterously inefficient.</strong></em></p><p>Incidentally, the magnificent inefficiency of stateless microservices makes
them to a certain extent a self-serving paradigm: in order to scale up you
might think you need them, but once you have them, they will perform so badly,
that boy oh boy, are you going to need to scale up!</p><p>Another problem with stateless microservices is that they cannot take any
initiative of their own, they are restricted to only responding to incoming
requests. This poses a problem with server-initiated client updates, which in
certain circles are known as "push notifications". A server-initiated client
update happens when the server decides to send some data to the client at an
arbitrary moment in time, as a result of some event occurring on the server,
without the client first having to request that data.</p><p>Actually, the very term "push notification" seems to have originated from
system designs in which such sending of data is a difficult task, as if the
developers have to put their shoulders against the notification and push it
all together to make it straddle the great divide between the server and the
client. In other designs, where asynchronous bi-directional communication is
the default mode of operation, there is no need for such laboriousness;
server-initiated client updates are just part of the normal way things work.
Alas, you cannot have that with stateless microservices, because
bi-directional communication requires the notion of a session, which in turn
implies a notion of state, which is a no-no.</p><p>Consequently, software systems that utilize the stateless microservice design
pattern address the problem of server-initiated client updates in various
wacky hacky ways:</p></li><li><p>Some opt to not have any; if the user wants to see what has changed, let
them refresh the page. This can cause serious problems in systems where
multiple clients may edit the same data, since the system has no way of
alerting a client that the data they are editing is also being edited by
another client at the same time.</p></li><li><p>Some use polling, meaning that each client keeps sending requests to the
server at regular intervals asking whether there are any updates. This is wasteful, because each of these requests represents work that needs to
be done, but very few of them will result in anything useful happening. At
the same time, in order to reduce server load, the polling cannot be too
frequent, which in turn means that there will always be a time
lapse between the moment that an event occurs on the server and the moment
that the clients take notice.</p></li><li><p>Some opt to have special stateful modules working side by side with the
stateless microservices to handle the push notifications in a completely
separate way, under the assumption that notifications are a kind of optional, "nice to have" thing anyway, so if performance suffers due to lack
of scaling, or if service is interrupted due to lack of resilience, it will
not hurt too much. On top of being clunky, this approach is also
short-sighted because from the entire broad topic of server-initiated client
updates it only considers the narrow case of updates being used for the sole
purpose of on-screen notifications.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=/post/2021-10-14-the-stateful-microservice/>The Stateful Microservice</a></p></li></ul><hr><p>Cover image: <em>Dory</em>, the yellow-blue fish (a <em>Royal Blue Tang</em>) that
