People give some good troubleshooting hints, but nobody seems to have an actual solution.</p><p>The svchost.exe process which causes the problem contains the following services:</p><ul><li>Application Information (AppInfo)</li><li>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)</li><li>Certificate Propagation (CertPropSvc)</li><li>Computer Browser (Browser)</li><li>Multimedia Class Scheduler (MMCSS)</li><li>Remote Desktop Configuration (SessionEnv)</li><li>Shell Hardware Detection (ShellHWDetection)</li><li>System Event Notification Service (SENS)</li><li>Server (LanmanServer)</li><li>Task Scheduler (Schedule)</li><li>Themes (Themes)</li><li>User Profile Service (ProfSvc)</li><li>Windows Update (wuauserv)</li><li>Windows Management Instrumentation (Winmgmt)</li></ul><p>I decided to give the process of elimination a try. I was able to terminate most of those services without seeing any difference in behavior. The one service which absolutely refuses to terminate is the Task Scheduler: Apparently someone at Microsoft has decided that scheduled tasks are such an awesome thing to have, that nobody in their right minds should ever want to try running Windows without them.</p><p>So, the culprit appears to be the Task Scheduler, but what can be done about it? How can we make it stop hoarding our precious RAM?</p><p>I think I have found a solution.</p><p>Now, this is a complex problem which could have different causes on different systems out there, so this may or may not solve your particular problem; however, it has solved my problem, and that's why I am saying I have found <em>a</em> solution, not <em>the</em> solution. You can read on for the possibility that your problem is the same as mine, or just for the possibility that my troubleshooting approach helps you find a solution to your particular problem.</p><p>Open up the <em>Control Panel</em>, open up <em>Administrative Tools</em>, and launch the <em>Task Scheduler</em> console. There are many, I mean <em>many</em> tasks in there, but luckily the one we are interested in is easy to find: From the tree on the left side, select <em>Task Scheduler Library</em>, and in the middle pane you will see a bunch of tasks scheduled for execution. Keep hitting F5 to refresh, and in the <em>Last Run Time</em> column you will see which one of those tasks keeps repeatedly firing: it is the one whose last run time keeps changing with every refresh. In my case the offending task was the <em>Adobe Flash Player Updater</em>. So, right click on that task, and select <em>Disable</em>. Voil?, CPU consumption goes to zero, and memory consumption goes down to the normal 40 megabytes or so. More importantly, they both stay there.</p><p>So, after all, in my case the culprit was not really the Task Scheduler, it was the Adobe Flash Player Updater. Thank you, Adobe! You rock!</p><p>Not.</p><p>Cheers!</p><p><strong>Old comments</strong></p><ul><li><p>Anonymous 2015-05-09 19:24:28 UTC</p><p>Only 9 comments so far? I guess everybody must be too lazy to say thank you, because I assume the number of people helped with this piece of information is higher by some orders of magnitude. While it may not have precisely fixed what I was looking for (or it indeed may, I'll see in the coming days), but in any case, just learning about the existence of this scheduler and how to modify it, is very valuable for all of us non-IT-professionals.</p></li><li><p>Unspecified 2016-06-11 16:00:02 UTC</p><p>Help me please i'm dying right now, i've follow all the things you said on top, and i've read all the comments i was so happy that i found google updater BUT it wasnt the real problem, everytime i refresh it nothing changes.

Windows Update problems are a separate ocean of pain.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Unspecified 2016-02-04 10:28:16 UTC</p><p>HOLY SHIT! Thank you! You are a messiah and the liberator. My problem wasn't any of those pesky tasks, but windows updater. Apparently I hadn't been updating as much as Microsoft would like, so they decided to wreck my Windows' performance. Well, now the whole update-reminder crap is off and I intend to find a way to keep it that way.</p><ul><li><p><a class=external href=http://michael.gr target=_blank>michael.gr</a> 2016-02-04 13:53:05 UTC</p><p>I am glad to be useful, Paavo!

I wasn't able to identify the culprit but disabled all Google update related tasks, Adobe Flash update and Dropbox update. I also uninstalled GoToMeeting. Let's see what happens after reboot</p></li><li><p>Anonymous 2014-05-09 13:31:43 UTC</p><p>THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! This worked perfectly.
