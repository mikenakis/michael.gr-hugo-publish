But now that you reminded me of it, I will give it another try.</p></li><li><p><a class=external href=http://oligofren.wordpress.com target=_blank>Carl-Erik</a> 2023-01-27 09:13:18 UTC</p><p>Hi, Michael. I feel the pain :-) Finding such forums is generally not easy. For answerable questions the StackExchange network is a gem; StackOverflow for the technical details and the Software Engineering for more high-level stuff.</p><p>But they both eschew open-ended discussions, which is what I find that you are seeking. One surprising newcomer might be DEV. For a while, I thought this was a curated site where one found low-quality articles on "This is how you do X in React", etc. It was only when I critiqued the quality of one such article that I found out that it is basically Medium for programmers: a self-publication platform with comments. So that answered the quality bit: it depends on the author.</p><p>But recently, I have found that more senior software developers write here as well and some of these resulting discussions have been really, really good! One such example is the discussion that spiralled out of this innocuous looking piece called "Whatever happened to components being just a visual thing":
<a class=external href=https://dev.to/redbar0n/what-happened-to-components-being-just-a-visual-thing-22hc target=_blank>https://dev.to/redbar0n/what-happened-to-components-being-just-a-visual-thing-22hc</a></p><p>Super interesting tidbits in a day where frontend architecture talks usually are super shallow. Turns out what I have been missing is discussion of "app-centric" architectures vs the nowadays more common "component-centric" architecture (what we are mostly doing). Loads of great stuff, even though some of the stuff went over my head.</p><p>Keywords from the discussion that spanned tens of comments, some spanning thousands of words:
Steve Krug (of "Don't make me think"), Martin Fowler (of everything software design related), Pete Hunt (of the original React team), Pete Heard, reactive programming, MVC, MVVM, Robert C. Martin's, Trygve Reenskaug, Smalltalk, Active Record, template languages vs JS, Niladic Components, ...</p><p>The discussion essentially touches everything one ever learned about software architecture and design mixed into a greater discussion on how frontends can, have and should be designed.
