many different descriptions, exhibiting considerable difference of opinion.
Most claims about microservices are non-technical rather than technical, for
example the allegedly "independent" software development style around
microservices, or some alleged organization of microservices "around business
capabilities". Even when the claims do stick within the technical realm, they
are often unwarranted; for example, I have seen statements to the effect that
a microservice is supposed to live in its very own source code repository,
that microservices must communicate with each other via nothing but REST, etc.
My favorite one is that they must necessarily be stateless. This paper is a
first step in dispelling the statelessness myth.</p><p>(Useful pre-reading: <a href=/post/2022-11-about-these-papers/>About these papers</a>)</p><p>To clear up the confusion a little bit, I would like to propose a purely
technical definition of a microservice which is brief and to the point:</p><blockquote><p>From a purely technical standpoint, a microservice is a scalable module.</p></blockquote><p>So, what I am proposing here is that the only fundamental technical
requirement for a microservice is scalability, and that all other purported
characteristics mentioned in the literature are either non-technical, or they
are byproducts of this fundamental technical requirement.</p><p>You see, there was a time back in the late 1990s to early 2000s when users
were joining websites at exponential rates, and servers running monolithic web
apps were reaching capacity and could not deliver service anymore; the
business people were asking the technologists to fix this, because they were
losing money, and the technologists were saying that they could not do
anything, because they already had the biggest, most expensive server that
money could buy. The business people would na?vely say "well, add more
servers!" to which the technologists would (equally na?vely) reply "you don't
understand, that's impossible!" Later on the technologists started realizing
that it is in fact possible, it just requires a radical change in their way of
thinking, and a radical redesign of all their systems. When the sums of money
at stake were high enough to justify redoing everything from scratch, scalable
systems started appearing, and are commonplace today.</p><p>The new software development paradigm that was allowing web sites to achieve
scalability received a name quite some time after it first started being put
to use; the naming happened some time in the mid 2000s, and it was
<em>microservices</em>.</p><p>Then of course came the evangelists. Unfortunately, when people become
salespersons of a cause, for some reason they never seem to be satisfied with
simply mentioning the one real, game-changing advantage that their product has
over the alternatives; instead, they feel compelled to throw as much as
possible at the customer, inventing advantages if possible. That's how all the
fictitious characteristics of microservices came to be. However, the truth
remains that there was one and only one thing that business needed which could
not be achieved otherwise, and therefore business was willing to pay for it
limitlessly, and that one thing was scalability, nothing else. (1)</p><p>Business could not care less whether the software gets deployed in pieces or
in a big bang; business could not care less whether development is done by
autonomous teams or by all the programmers shouting at each other in one big
room; business could not care less whether the software communicates via REST
or via pheromone secretion. Things were getting done before, and things would
continue getting done, regardless of those alleged "advantages" of
microservices. Scalability was the only thing that was impossible before
microservices and was made possible by microservices.</p><p>Of course, you might not agree with this definition; if not, then please take
it as nothing but a working definition, and only for the purpose of these
papers about statelessness.</p><p>There is one more characteristic of microservices which is not really fundamental, because it is a direct
consequence of the first, but it is so
important that it deserves mentioning as a requirement, and this is resilience.</p><p>You see, scalable architectures are not magically capable of performing better
than monolithic ones; in fact, quite the opposite is true: in terms of raw
throughput per unit of hardware, scalable architectures perform much worse
than monolithic ones. In order to accommodate the same workload that you used
to have with a single server running a monolithic application, you might need several
servers running microservices. The benefit of the scalable architecture is
that you can in fact now throw more hardware at the problem, instead of being
stuck with a single piece of hardware. So, given enough money to buy enough
hardware you can end up with a higher sum of throughput despite the worse
throughput per unit of hardware. Thus, when we are talking about scalability, we
are usually talking about a lot of hardware. And by this I mean <em>an awful lot</em> of hardware.</p><p>Now, it just so happens that hardware, being necessarily bound to the
constraints of the <em>physical world?</em>, has this inconvenient
characteristic called "Mean Time Before Failure" (MTBF) which is of a somewhat
statistical nature: the more pieces of hardware you have, the higher the
chances are that any one of them will fail at any given moment. Furthermore,
as these pieces age, their individual chances of failure at any given moment
increase. The result of all this is that hardware failure in server farms
becomes not just something that there is a high risk of; not even just
something that is inevitable; it actually becomes a regularly occurring
phenomenon. As such, hardware failure cannot be addressed on an as-needed
basis via crisis management responses; it must be addressed systematically, as
a normal part of the operation of the system. This means that the software
that runs on that hardware must be capable of continuing to function as if
nothing happened despite pieces of the hardware randomly failing and being
replaced all the time.</p><p>A software system that manages to continue functioning despite parts of it
ceasing to work is called a resilient software system. If we want to add the
resilience concern into our definition, then this is what we are left with:</p><blockquote><p>From a purely technical standpoint, a microservice is a scalable and resilient
module.</p></blockquote><p>Further reading: <a href=/post/2021-10-on-stateless-microservices/>On Stateless Microservices</a></p><hr><p>(1) According to Neal Ford, this started with Pets.com; see <a class=external href="https://youtu.be/fYWvTYFmVYs?t=2156" target=_blank>Neal Ford: "Stories Every Developer Should Know" at YOW! 2018, starting at 35:56</a></p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/software-architecture/>Software Architecture</a>
