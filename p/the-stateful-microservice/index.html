   >About these papers</a>)</p>
<p>Almost everyone doing microservices today will tell you that microservices
need to be stateless. In another post of mine I explain that statelessness is
not an end in and of itself; instead, it is just a means to an end. The
desired technical ends are scalability and resilience, and statelessness is just one way of achieving them. Furthermore, I explain that statelessness
in particular is a very cowardly solution from an engineering standpoint, and
it performs very badly. For details, please see
<a 
   href="/p/on-stateless-microservices/"
   >On Stateless Microservices</a>.</p>
<p>What remains to be shown is whether there exists an alternative.</p>
<p>Obviously, an alternative to the stateless microservice would be the stateful
microservice, so what we are about to examine here is what a stateful
microservice could possibly be, and how it would compare to a stateless
microservice.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-stateful-microservice">What is a stateful microservice
</h4><p>A stateful microservice maintains state for the purpose of expediting the
processing of incoming requests, reducing overall server load, (trading memory
for processing power and data storage traffic,) and achieving certain things
that are difficult to achieve otherwise, such as server-initiated client
updates.</p>
<p>The state kept by a stateful microservice can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>State that has been obtained from the main data store and has possibly
undergone expensive transformations. The benefit of maintaining such
transient state within the microservice is that the data store does not
need to be re-queried, and the possibly expensive transformations do not
need to be repeated, with each incoming request; the loading and
processing of the data only needs to happen once when the microservice
starts, and to be repeated only in response to a notification from the
system&rsquo;s messaging backbone that the original data in the main data store
has changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State that does not exist in the main data store, and does not need to,
because it is of a transient nature, for example information that is only
needed during user&rsquo;s visit to a web site and can be dismissed afterwards.
This can include information necessary for maintaining a session, such as
the session token, and view-related information, such as which page (or
pages) of the web site the user is currently viewing. View-related
information may be useful for the server to have for various reasons, for
example for the purpose of sending server-initiated client updates that
are specific to the web page(s) that are being viewed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State that may eventually be entered into the main data store but has not
yet been entered due to various workflow demands or optimization concerns.
For example, the user may be sequentially visiting each page of a wizard
workflow, and entering information on each page, but this information
should not be merged into the main data store unless the user first
reaches the last page of the wizard workflow and confirms their actions.</p>
<p>From the above it should be obvious that a stateful microservice is
necessarily session-oriented, meaning that it requires a specific client to
talk to. Session-agnostic stateful microservices already exist, and we do not
think of them as anything special; they are microservices that implement
caches, containing information that is pertinent to not just one client, but
to all clients. These microservices are already scalable and resilient because
a cache can be trivially duplicated to an arbitrary degree and it can also be
destroyed and trivially re-created from scratch.</p>
<p>We now need to show how a stateful microservice can still be called a
microservice.</p>
<p>In a previous post of mine I examined what a microservice really is, and I
came to the conclusion that from a purely technical standpoint, it is simply a scalable and resilient module. (See
<a 
   href="/p/so-what-is-a-microservice-anyway/"
   >So, what is a Microservice, anyway?</a>) Even if you disagree with this definition, and you regard microservices as
necessarily more than that, I hope you will at least agree that the purpose of
statelessness in microservices is precisely to achieve scalability and
resilience, so the definition of a microservice as a scalable and resilient
module can serve as a working definition for the purposes of this discussion.</p>
<p>So, we need to show how stateful microservices can be scalable and resilient,
just as their stateless counterparts are.</p>
<p>Scalability in stateful microservices can be achieved by means of a
header-inspecting, session-aware, load balancing gateway which routes new
session requests to the least busy server, and from that moment on keeps
routing requests of that same session to the same server. Under such a
scenario, rebalancing of the server farm can be achieved simply by killing
microservices on overloaded servers and letting the resilience mechanism
described next make things right.</p>
<p>Resilience can be achieved by having each instance of a stateful microservice
continuously persisting its transient state in an efficient manner into a
high-performance backup store which is accessible by all servers in the farm.
Thus, if a microservice unexpectedly ceases to exist, it can be reconstructed
from that backup on any other server. The trick, as we shall see, is that the
backup is taken very efficiently, and in the event that the microservice needs
to be reconstructed, the restoration from the backup is also done very
efficiently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In more detail, it works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a client initially connects to the server farm, no session has been
established yet, so the first request that it sends is sessionless.</li>
<li>The sessionless request arrives at the load-balancing gateway, which routes
it to the least busy server in the farm. This mostly takes care of
scalability, since we can always add more servers, which will initially be
idle, but as requests for new sessions keep arriving, they are routed to the
idle servers instead of the busy ones, so over time, the load distribution
evens out.</li>
<li>The server that receives the sessionless request creates a new instance of a
stateful microservice to handle that request, and the session is established
between that microservice and the client.</li>
<li>From that moment on, any further incoming requests for that same session are
routed by the gateway to the same server, and the server delegates them to
the same instance of the stateful microservice. (Alternatively, the
microservice and the client may negotiate a direct persistent connection
between the two, thus bypassing any middlemen from that moment on.)</li>
<li>The newly spawned stateful microservice registers with the messaging
backbone of the system to receive notifications about system-wide events, so
as to be able to keep its state always up to date.</li>
<li>The newly spawned stateful microservice loads whatever state it is going to
need, and keeps that state in memory.</li>
<li>The microservice processes the request and sends back a response.
<ul>
<li>Possibly also changing its own transient state.</li>
<li>Possibly also updating the main data store with information that must
always be globally available and up to date, and issuing system-wide
notifications about these changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The microservice takes a backup of itself.
<ul>
<li>The microservice serializes the entirety of its state into a binary blob</li>
<li>The blob is written into a persistent key-value store, using the session
id as the key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>This persistent key-value store is used as a backup, meaning that it is
written often, but it is never read unless something bad happens.
</code></pre></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuous persistence of stateful microservices is not expected to pose a
performance problem, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serialization to and from a binary format performs much better than
general-purpose serialization into a textual markup like JSON or XML.</li>
<li>The size of the blob is expected to be relatively small. (Of the order of
kilobytes.)</li>
<li>Key-value stores tend to have very high performance characteristics.</li>
<li>The backup store can be physically separate from the main data store,
(even on a different network,) thus avoiding contention.</li>
<li>The act of serializing an in-memory data structure into a single in-memory
blob and then sending that blob as one piece into persistent storage is
bound to perform far better than a series of operations to update a
structured data store. (For one thing, there are no index updates.)</li>
<li>Persisting the blob can be done asynchronously and in parallel to the
sending of the response to the client, so it does not contribute to
user-perceived latency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For as long as the session does not expire, the stateful microservice can
remain alive, continuing to serve requests efficiently, taking advantage of
the transient state that it contains and keeps up-to-date. Contrast this
with the stateless microservice approach, which requires that any request
can be handled by any server, therefore each microservice must contain no
state at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>The processing of each request begins with zero knowledge of the state of
the system, so persistent storage must always be queried to obtain state.</li>
<li>These queries represent overhead, and this overhead must be suffered in
full before the request can be serviced, thus manifesting as latency to
the user.</li>
<li>The results of these queries may not be cached, because they may at any
moment be rendered out-of-date by any other microservice in the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>An instance of a stateful microservice may prematurely cease to exist due to
a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The microservice may be terminated on demand in order to rebalance the
server farm.</li>
<li>The server hosting the microservice may become unavailable due to hardware
failure.</li>
<li>The microservice may fall victim to the whim of the chaos monkey.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If for whatever reason a microservice ceases to exist, the gateway discovers
this either on its own, or when the next request arrives from the client.</p>
<ul>
<li>The gateway routes the request to the least busy server in the farm.</li>
<li>The server that receives the request sees that there is no microservice to
handle requests for that session, so it creates a new one.</li>
<li>The newly instantiated microservice checks, whether the key-value store
contains a backup for the current session, and discovers that it does.</li>
<li>The microservice restores its state from the backup.</li>
<li>Operation continues from that moment on as if nothing happened.</li>
<li>Between the moment in time that a certain microservice instance
prematurely ceases to exist, and the moment in time that a new incarnation
of that microservice is ready for showtime on a freshly assigned server,
some events from the messaging backbone may be lost. To avoid
inconsistencies in the state of the microservice, we must utilize a
messaging backbone which is capable of replaying events. For example, if
we use Kafka, then the stateful microservice can make sure to include
among its persistent state what is known in Kafka terminology as the
&ldquo;consumer offset&rdquo;. Thus, when the microservice gets reconstructed, it asks
Kafka for events starting at that offset, so Kafka replays any missed
events before it starts sending new ones. Thus, we ensure that the state
of the microservice is always up to date, even in the case of termination
and reconstruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, stateful microservices can achieve not only scalability but also
resilience.</p>
