&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need is identified for programmatically ascertaining, in languages like C# and Java, the immutability of certain objects used in situations where they are expected to be immutable. The technicalities of immutability assessment are discussed. A mechanism is described for achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raise your hand if you have ever had to troubleshoot a bug that manifested itself in mysterious ways, defied rational explanation, tenaciously evaded detection, made you rage at the absurdity of the observed behavior, and after much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, turned out to be due to one of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inadvertently mutating an object that has been added as a key in a hash map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inadvertently mutating an object that has been passed to another thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in general:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One piece of code mutating an object that another piece of code groundlessly assumes that it remains unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mishaps of course happen due to the fact that the objects involved should have been immutable, but they were not. If an object is immutable, nobody can mutate it, and therefore nobody has to &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; that it will not change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, could hash maps somehow require that their keys be immutable? Could threads somehow require that objects shared among them be immutable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the more general question of how to ascertain immutability, which is certainly not an easy task. Most programmers don't even consider it; few talk about it; even fewer attempt it. Programmers all over the world are accustomed to routinely using objects in situations where immutability is an absolute requirement, but without ever ascertaining it, essentially &lt;em&gt;praying&lt;/em&gt; that the objects be immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="compiler-enforced-immutability"&gt;Compiler-Enforced Immutability
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inadvertent mutation is not a problem in purely functional programming languages, where there simply is no such thing as mutation. However, most programmers do not use such languages, because they are cumbersome to work with. Most programmers use languages like Java and C#, which are not purely functional, so they allow mutation, and so inadvertent mutation can sometimes happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java and C# do support a few constructs for defining invariable (final/readonly) class members, but they are woefully inadequate. Systematic compiler support for declaring and requiring immutability would greatly help to reduce the volume of mistakes being made, but nothing like that exists, and even if it did exist, it would not be a panacea, because there are situations where the compiler cannot help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since compiler-enforced immutability is not available, we have to enforce it ourselves, which means that we have to programmatically detect immutability and ascertain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Languages like Java and C# offer full reflection support, so we can examine every field of every type, (static analysis,) and we can even examine the values of fields of instances. (Dynamic analysis.) Furthermore, these languages compile into intermediate code, which is relatively easy to parse and reason about, meaning that we can even analyze executable code if we want to. (More static analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question is what to analyze, and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="superficial-vs-deep-immutability"&gt;Superficial vs. Deep Immutability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many classes have the term &amp;quot;immutable&amp;quot; in their name, but they are only superficially immutable. Take a generic immutable collection or example: &lt;code&gt;ImmutableCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Let us trust that it does in fact behave perfectly immutably, and therefore it does, arguably, deserve to be called immutable; let us now ask: would an instance of this class be safe to pass to another thread? The answer is that it depends on the actual type of the generic parameter: If &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is immutable, it is safe; but if &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; is mutable, then it is absolutely not safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to reap any benefits whatsoever from immutability, it must be deep immutability. Shallow immutability is irrelevant. Please keep this in mind, as it has severe implications in our quest to ascertain the immutability of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="static-analysis"&gt;Static Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;static analysis&amp;quot; refers to examining the code that makes a program, (as written, or as compiled,) but not the state of the program as it runs. Consequently, static analysis can examine the definitions of data structures, but not the actual contents of those data structures during runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular but naïve understanding of immutability is that it is an inherent characteristic of types, and that the instances of the types (i.e. the objects) simply follow suit. According to this understanding, all we need to do is to ascertain that a certain type is immutable, and from that moment on we know that all of its instances are immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding is not entirely false, but it is very limiting, because it means that only concrete and non-extensible (a.k.a. final, sealed) types can potentially be assessed as immutable: All interfaces must necessarily be considered as mutable, because we have no idea how they may be implemented, and all abstract or simply extensible types must also necessarily be considered as mutable, because we have no idea how they may be extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses an insurmountable problem if we wanted to have, say, a queue for exchanging messages between threads, where the messages are organized in a class hierarchy: such a queue would not be able to ascertain the immutability of the messages it handles, because all it knows is the base-most 'Message' class, which is necessarily extensible, and therefore mutable, as far as static analysis can tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, consider that many perfectly immutable classes tend to be passed around as interfaces, (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Comparer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Hasher&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Predicate&lt;/code&gt;, all sorts of stateless converters, etc.) that these interfaces are often stored in fields, and that a field of mutable type makes the class containing that field also mutable. It quickly becomes evident that static analysis can only work in a universe where no abstraction is utilized; however, we do not live in such a universe: we make use of languages like Java and C# precisely because we want the benefits of &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final nail in the coffin of static analysis is the issue of delayed immutability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="delayed-immutability"&gt;Delayed Immutability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some objects begin life as mutable, so that they can undergo some non-trivial initialization, and become immutable later, once initialization is complete. This behavior is necessary when creating cyclic graphs of immutable objects, or when creating an immutable object while loading its contents from some
external storage. (Alternative terms used by others for this kind of immutability are &lt;em&gt;Freezing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Popsicle immutability&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no standard way of representing delayed immutability, so let me propose one real quick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let there be a &lt;code&gt;SelfAssessing&lt;/code&gt; interface, which is to be implemented by any class that utilizes delayed immutability. This interface is to have just one method, &lt;code&gt;IsImmutable()&lt;/code&gt;, which is expected to return &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; for as long as the object is mutable, and to start returning &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; once the object becomes immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that static analysis is by nature limited to examining types, but delayed immutability requires invoking a method of an instance of a type. Thus, static analysis completely fails to assess delayed immutability. Furthermore, a delayed immutable may appear as a field in any type, meaning that static analysis fails to assess potentially any type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since static analysis fails in the presence of abstraction and/or delayed immutability, it follows that we have to examine not just types, but also the instances of types in the running software system. This calls for &lt;em&gt;dynamic analysis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dynamic-analysis"&gt;Dynamic Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;dynamic analysis&amp;quot; refers to examining various aspects of a software system as it runs. In some cases the aim is to examine the behavior of the software, in other cases (such as the case at hand) it is to examine the data structures it creates. Dynamic analysis may require (and in the case at hand it does require) static analysis as a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dynamic analysis we can look past the advertised type of a field, which may be abstract, and obtain the instance stored in the field, (the value of the field,) in order to find out the actual, concrete type of that instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have the concrete type of an instance, we can assess whether it is immutable, and this may involve recursively assessing any instances referenced by that instance. If everything is immutable, then and only then can the containing instance assessed as immutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make all of this work, we begin with static analysis where we use reflection to examine a type with the goal of giving it one of &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; possible assessments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immutable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inconclusive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These type assessments are issued as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;mutable&lt;/strong&gt; type assessment is issued if:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type has any fields that are variable, (non-final/non-readonly,) because such fields are mutable no matter what their advertised type (field type) is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type has nothing but invariable fields, but one or more of them is of an advertised type that has received a mutable assessment, because this means that the containing type is not deeply immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;immutable&lt;/strong&gt; type assessment is issued if a type consists exclusively of fields that are both invariable and of an advertised type which has received an immutable assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;inconclusive&lt;/strong&gt; type assessment is issued if:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type is abstract or extensible (non-final/non-sealed.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type is self-assessing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The type contains any fields of an advertised type that has in turn received an inconclusive assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the above are &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; assessments, issued on types, by static analysis alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every instance of a type that has received a mutable or immutable assessment is in turn mutable or immutable without the need to examine the contents of the instance; however, every instance of a type that has received an inconclusive assessment must be further examined to issue a final assessment for that instance only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of each field must be obtained from the instance, and assessment must recursively be applied on that value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the type is self-assessing, then the &lt;code&gt;IsImmutable()&lt;/code&gt; method must be invoked on the instance, to ask it whether it is immutable or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both type assessment and instance assessment can be expensive; however, note the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a type assessment has been issued, it will never change, so it can be
cached, and never recomputed again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instance assessments can be requested only from within assertions, meaning
that they can incur zero runtime overhead on production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that for static analysis we employed nothing but reflection to examine the fields of a type, and for dynamic analysis we also employed nothing but reflection to examine the values of fields of instances, so no code analysis was necessary. However, for the sake of completeness, let us also take a brief look at code analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="code-analysis"&gt;Code analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a school of thought according to which the answer to the immutability assessment question lies in analyzing the executable instructions that comprise a type to determine whether any fields are mutated by code outside of the constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with code analysis is that it is a form of static analysis, so it suffers from the disadvantages of static analysis that were previously explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that code analysis determines that a type does not mutate any fields outside of its constructor; suppose, however, that the type contains a field of abstract type, which gets initialized from a constructor parameter; is this type mutable or immutable? Obviously, it depends on the concrete type of the instance that will be stored, at runtime, in that field. So, we are back at square one, where static analysis simply does not work in the face of abstraction. Therefore, code analysis is not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code analysis could potentially be useful, as a supplement to dynamic analysis, in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some cases, a type contains a field which is written by a method other than the constructor. For this to work, the field has to be variable. (Non-final/non-readonly.) Thus, with the use of reflection alone, this type will be assessed as mutable. However, it may be that the method which writes the field makes sure that the field is only written once during the lifetime of the instance, and that it gets written before it is ever read, so it will never appear to mutate as far as external observers can tell. Thus, the type is effectively immutable. It is in theory possible (though not easy) for code analysis to detect that the field is treated in this way, thus allowing the type to be assessed as immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes a type contains fields that are only written by the constructor, but the programmer who wrote that type forgot to declare them as invariable (final/readonly) and did not pay attention to the warnings / inspections / analysis messages. If we were to only use reflection, these fields would be considered variable, so the type would in turn be assessed as mutable. Code analysis can detect that the fields are not written outside of the constructor, allowing them to be assessed as invariable, and therefore the type to be assessed as immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="preassessment"&gt;Preassessment
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There exist types that would normally receive a mutable assessment, but we know for sure that they are practically immutable. A famous example of such a type, both in Java and in C#, is class &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. In such cases, we must be able to &lt;em&gt;preassess&lt;/em&gt; the type as immutable, which means to assign an immutable assessment to the type, without analyzing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that preassessment constitutes a promise, and promises can be false. If a type which is actually mutable is mistakenly preassessed as immutable, bad things are bound to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generic-shallow-preassessment"&gt;Generic Shallow Preassessment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some generic types are effectively immutable containers. In Java, which uses type erasure, these are essentially containers of elements of type &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;, so they are by definition inconclusive; however, in C# the type of the generic type argument is known at runtime, so we do better than that. When a generic effectively immutable container type is constructed with an actual type parameter, the immutability of the resulting type depends on the immutability of that parameter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the generic type parameter is a mutable type, then the constructed generic container type is mutable, so instances of that type do not need to be assessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the generic type parameter is an immutable type, then the constructed generic container type is immutable, so again, instances of that type do not need to be assessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the generic type parameter is inconclusive, then the constructed generic container type is inconclusive, which means that for every instance of that type, all elements in the container must be assessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to assess the elements of a container, the preassessment for the container must include an object known as a &lt;em&gt;deconstructor&lt;/em&gt;. Dynamic analysis will be invoking the deconstructor to enumerate the elements contained within each instance of the container, so that each element can be assessed. Deconstructors are generally trivial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deconstructor for collections simply yields all the elements of the collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deconstructor for maps/dictionaries simply yields all the mappings. (Map entries / key-value pairs.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deconstructor for &lt;code&gt;Lazy&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; simply yields the one and only value contained within the lazy object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preassessment is mainly intended for types that have been defined by others, and thus we cannot modify their source code. For types that we write ourselves, we want a finer level of control: we want to be able to override the assessment of specific fields only, and allow all other fields to be assessed the normal way, to catch situations where we thought that some field was immutable, while in fact assessment of that field shows that it is not immutable. For that, we need &lt;em&gt;field overrides&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="field-overrides"&gt;Field Overrides
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a field is variable, but we want to promise that we will only vary it in an effectively immutable way. For such cases, there must be an annotation/attribute that we can attach to that field, to indicate that analysis should treat the field as invariable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="array-field-overrides"&gt;Array Field Overrides
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrays are by definition mutable in Java and C#, and by extension so is any type that contains an array field, even if the field itself is invariable. If we want to be able to create an immutable type that contains an array field, there must be an annotation/attribute that we can attach to that array field, to indicate that analysis should treat the array itself as invariable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="elucidation"&gt;Elucidation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we have immutability assessment working as described in the preceding sections, a new challenge becomes apparent: sometimes, a data structure that was intended to be immutable will be assessed as mutable due to some tiny programmer mistake. If the data structure is large and complex, it might not be obvious where the mistake is. The programmer will receive a mutable assessment, but will not know why it was given and where to look to find the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, every mutable instance assessment must come with a sentence explaining to the programmer why the assessment was issued. Since every mutable instance assessment typically has one or more other assessments that are the reasons that led to it, these sentences will often form entire trees, each sentence being further explained by nested sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this feature elucidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="appendix"&gt;Appendix
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immutability assessment is awesome, but the more the compiler can do for us, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of what compilers of (non-purely functional) programming languages could be doing for us in the direction of compiler-enforced immutability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A language could support an 'immutable' class modifier, which would require the class to contain only immutable members. An immutable class may not extend a mutable class, and a mutable class may not extend an immutable class. (Although a mutable class may extend a class which has not been marked as immutable, even if that class happens to be immutable.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A language could support an 'immutable' modifier for function arguments and for fields, requiring that they may only be assigned from concrete types that are immutable, or from other fields or function arguments that are also immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A language could support an 'immutable' generic parameter constraint, which would mandate that only immutable types can be used as generic type arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A language could support a 'stable' field modifier, allowing a mutable field to appear in an immutable class, and acting as a promise that the field will only be mutated in a way which upholds effective immutability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A language could support a 'stable array' field modifier for array fields, allowing an array to appear in an immutable class, and acting as a promise that the contents of the array will either not be mutated, or they will only be mutated in a way which upholds effective immutability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type names as reported by the dotnet runtime are in a cryptic, non-human-readable format. Attempts by many to solve this problem have generally been naive, incomplete, and clunky. A library that gets the job done right is presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEARL: In dotnet, the &lt;code&gt;System.Type.Name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.Type.FullName&lt;/code&gt; properties return type names in a cryptic format which is not human-readable and bears very little resemblance to the names of the same types as they appear in C# source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The examples above demonstrate the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language keywords for built-in types are not used; instead, the raw CLR type names are used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names of nested classes are delimited with a plus-sign instead of a period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names of generic types do not use angle-bracket notation; instead, they are suffixed with a back-quote character, followed by the number of generic parameters they accept. The original generic type parameter names are nowhere to be found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names of constructed generic types are further suffixed with a list of fully qualified (assembly-qualified) type names, one for each generic type argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names of nullable value types do not use the question-mark shorthand notation; instead, the &lt;code&gt;System.Nullable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type is fully spelled out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these cryptic names are intended to be parsed by software, not by humans. Additionally, there are many different programming languages in the dotnet ecosystem, each with its own syntax for types, so the chosen notation does not favor any particular language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all very fine, and it should not really be a problem, because among the tens of thousands of APIs built into dotnet, there must surely be one for obtaining the human-readable name of a type in C# notation, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing built into dotnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest there is to it involves referencing the &lt;code&gt;System.CodeDom&lt;/code&gt; assembly (by Microsoft) and writing the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var cSharpCompiler = new Microsoft.CSharp.CSharpCodeProvider();&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var typeRef = new System.CodeDom.CodeTypeReference( type );&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;string typeName = cSharpCompiler.GetTypeOutput( typeRef );&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will give you namespace-qualified human-readable type names in C# notation, and it will even replace names of built-in types with their corresponding language keywords, so it will give you &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;System.Int32&lt;/code&gt;, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even then, the generated type names suffer in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you wanted the underlying CLR type names instead of the language keywords, you can't have them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you wanted type names without namespaces, you can't have them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The question-mark shorthand notation for nullable value types is not used, so you get &lt;code&gt;System.Nullable&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;int?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuple notation is not used, so you get &lt;code&gt;ValueTuple&amp;lt;int,char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;(int,char)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generic type arguments are stripped from generic type definitions, so you get &lt;code&gt;System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&amp;lt;,&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you wanted the full original generic type definition, which is &lt;code&gt;System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&amp;lt;TKey,TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you can't have it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although language keywords are used for most built-in types, they are not used for &lt;code&gt;nint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nuint&lt;/code&gt;, which appear as &lt;code&gt;System.IntPtr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.UIntPtr&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the above behavior can be changed, because the mechanism is not customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prior-attempts-to-solve-the-problem"&gt;Prior attempts to solve the problem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have asked for a function that, given a type, returns its human-readable name in C# notation, and many have tried to offer such a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Stack Overflow there is not just one, but several questions asking this, or variations of it, and each question has received several (attempted) answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, all of the above attempts are incomplete and clunky. Some people provide functions that only work for a specific set of types, such as &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;,&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but fail for everything else; others provide functions that try to work for any type, but fail in all sorts of edge cases, and even not-so-edge cases, for example with arrays or with nested types. Even the best solutions fail to cover all cases. Furthermore, virtually all of the code in these solutions is of very poor quality, engaging in excessive string searching, string substitution, string concatenation, etc. It is really so messy that it cannot be improved; it has to be thrown away and re-written from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-solution"&gt;The solution

&lt;h3 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popular practice of having only two different kinds of builds (&lt;em&gt;Debug&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Release&lt;/em&gt;) is shown to be inadequate. Three to four different kinds of builds are proposed instead, allowing more thorough error checking during development, better performance of the final system on production, and potentially better performance when running tests on a build server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-issue"&gt;The Issue
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In software development we often want our creations to have different characteristics under different circumstances; for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizations:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While developing we usually do not want them, because they interfere with debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the final shipped product we want them, because they make it run faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preconditions, assertions, and other kinds of runtime checks:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While developing we want them, because they help us catch bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the final shipped product we do not want them, because they slow it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-history"&gt;The History
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C and C++, different behavior has historically been achieved by means of compiler options controlling optimization, and preprocessor macros controlling conditional compilation. The standard stipulates an NDEBUG macro which, if defined, causes assertions to compile to nothing. This means that software systems written in C and C++ generally have two builds: a &lt;em&gt;Debug&lt;/em&gt; build, for use while debugging, and a &lt;em&gt;Release&lt;/em&gt; build, for shipping or deploying to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Java came along, it was decided that a single build should be good for everyone: conditional compilation was abolished&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, all optimization-related choices were delegated to the Just-In-Time compiler (JITter,) assertions were made to always compile into the binaries, and the &lt;code&gt;enableassertions&lt;/code&gt; switch was added to the virtual machine for controlling during runtime, rather than during compilation, whether assertions should be executing or not. This essentially gives Java developers the ability to choose between a &lt;em&gt;debug &lt;strong&gt;run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;release &lt;strong&gt;run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to a debug build or a release build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C# has brought back a compiler option for controlling optimization, and conditional compilation by means of a simplified version of the preprocessor macros (called &amp;quot;define constants&amp;quot; in C#) and the &lt;code&gt;Conditional&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Two different kinds of builds (called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Configurations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) are predefined: &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt;. The build system offers great flexibility in defining additional build configurations, but C# developers rarely bother with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since developers rarely bother with defining any build configurations besides the predefined ones, the vast majority of dotnet projects use only the two predefined ones: 'Debug' and 'Release'. (Many projects actually use only 'Debug', but let us pretend we never heard of them.) Thus all different needs and usage scenarios are being shoe-horned to fit into one of those two options. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is only one configuration that can be tested, namely the &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; configuration, which means that this configuration is used not only for running tests on a developer's computer, but also for running tests on the build server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is only one configuration of a library that can be published, namely the 'Release' configuration, which means that this configuration is used not only in production scenarios, but also in development scenarios, where software is being developed that is making use of a published library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is problematic because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It slows down test runs on build servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'Debug' configuration is unoptimized, to avoid interference with debugging; however, by common practice, the same 'Debug' configuration is used for running tests on the build server, because that is the only configuration that can be tested; thus, the world is full of build servers executing unoptimized tests, exercising unoptimized code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tests and the code they are exercising are long-running and computationally expensive, lack of optimization will make them run even slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, virtually nothing ever gets debugged on a build server, so there is virtually never a need to have it running unoptimized code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It slows down the software on production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a library is published as a package, the configuration that gets packaged is, by common practice, the 'Release' configuration. This configuration executes preconditions, since it may be referenced by a project under development; however, at some point, that project together with the library are released to production, where the library is still executing preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This amounts to nothing but a waste of clock cycles, because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the software using the library gets shipped to production, it has been tested and can be reasonably assumed to be invoking the library only in valid ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the software did happen to make invalid use of the library on production, it makes very little difference whether the resulting catastrophic failure would be signaled by a precondition failure or by some index out of range exception further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many preconditions are omitted in the name of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Library programmers often refrain from asserting certain preconditions, if they suspect them to be even slightly expensive, in light of the fact that preconditions in a library will always be executing, even on production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extreme example to illustrate this scenario is the binary search function, which should, in principle, be enforcing the precondition that the array to search must be sorted. Yes, this means guarding a &lt;strong&gt;O(log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(N))&lt;/strong&gt; operation with a &lt;strong&gt;O(N)&lt;/strong&gt; operation. This is fine during development, because we test with small amounts of data anyway, but is a terrible thing to be doing on production; thus, there is virtually no library in existence with such a precondition in it, despite the fact that it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-solution"&gt;The Solution
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the description of the problem it becomes evident that preconditions must be controlled separately from assertions, and both of those must be controlled separately from optimizations. Therefore, four different build configurations can be thought of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'Debug' configuration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is more or less already familiar with this. It is meant for use by a developer when testing and debugging software on their local computer. Assertions are enabled, preconditions are enabled, and optimizations are disabled, because they interfere with debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 'Optimized' configuration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same as Debug except that optimizations are enabled. It is meant to run on the build server, where we do not usually debug, so there is no reason to be running unoptimized software. Note that this configuration is only useful for projects that suffer from long-running, computationally expensive tests; projects that do testing right, with very short and lightweight tests, are likely to see a performance degradation from this configuration, due to the additional JITting overhead &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'Develop' configuration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This configuration is only applicable to libraries, not to applications. It is identical to what was previously understood as the Release configuration, where optimizations are enabled, assertions are disabled, and preconditions are enabled; however, it is only meant to be used when developing software that makes use of the library, not for shipping to production, because we do not want to be executing preconditions on production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'Release' configuration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the Develop configuration, except that preconditions are also disabled. It is the configuration which is meant for shipping to production. Note that the benefit of using this configuration is not just maximum performance on production; it is also the freedom to add as many preconditions as necessary to the library, knowing that they cost nothing on production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the feature matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right"&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;⬜&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;⬜&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;✅&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;⬜&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;⬜&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt from a &lt;code&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; file implementing the above matrix, assuming that we have defined our own set of assertion functions, dependent upon an &lt;code&gt;ASSERTIONS&lt;/code&gt; define-constant, and our own set of precondition functions, dependent upon a &lt;code&gt;PRECONDITIONS&lt;/code&gt; define-constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Deterministic&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;True&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Deterministic&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;DeterministicSourcePaths&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;True&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/DeterministicSourcePaths&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/When&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;Otherwise&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Otherwise&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Choose&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we follow this build configuration scheme, then each time we publish a library we must generate two packages: the 'Develop' package, and the 'Release' package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 'Develop' package is to be referenced by software under development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 'Release' package is to be referenced by software that is being shipped to production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation of two different packages for a single library can be accomplished by building twice, once for each configuration, and constructing the assembly name as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;AssemblyName&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;$(MSBuildProjectName)-$(Configuration)&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/AssemblyName&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way, instead of a single package called &lt;code&gt;MyPackage&lt;/code&gt; we create two packages: &lt;code&gt;MyPackage-Develop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MyPackage-Release&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be a better way to build a library, so that only one package gets generated, containing both the develop and release builds, and the right binaries somehow end up in the right output directory; however, I have not been able to figure that out yet. If you know how to do it, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any build configuration of a certain module, (either an application or a library,) the build configuration of the libraries it uses can be determined using the following table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Build configuration of&lt;br&gt;module using library&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center"&gt;Build configuration of&lt;br&gt;library&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Debug'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Develop'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Optimized'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Develop'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Develop'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Develop'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Release'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center"&gt;'Release'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the 'Develop' configuration of a module could, in theory, make use of the better-performing 'Release' configuration of a library, instead of the 'Develop' configuration; however, that can only work if the module does not expose the library, or if there is no other module in the solution that uses the 'Develop' configuration of the library. Otherwise, there are going to be build errors saying that a certain type exists in both the develop and release configuration of a certain library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excerpt of a .csproj file implementing the above table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;PackagesConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Condition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#39;$(Configuration)&amp;#39;==&amp;#39;Debug&amp;#39;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Develop&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/PackagesConfiguration&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;PackagesConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Condition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#39;$(Configuration)&amp;#39;==&amp;#39;Optimized&amp;#39;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Develop&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/PackagesConfiguration&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;PackagesConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Condition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#39;$(Configuration)&amp;#39;==&amp;#39;Develop&amp;#39;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Develop&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/PackagesConfiguration&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;PackagesConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Condition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#39;$(Configuration)&amp;#39;==&amp;#39;Release&amp;#39;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Release&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/PackagesConfiguration&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, packages can be referenced as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Include=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;MyPackage-$(PackagesConfiguration)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;Version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An 'Optimized' build configuration has been proposed, for cutting in half the time it takes to run slow, computationally expensive tests on build servers. (Not needed by projects with small, fast tests.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 'Develop' build configuration for libraries has been proposed, intended for use during development of software using the libraries, but not for shipping to production. It has preconditions enabled, in order to catch bugs in the software using the libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 'Release' build configuration for libraries has been proposed, intended for shipping to production. It improves performance by not executing preconditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the proposed schema, preconditions in libraries do not incur a performance penalty on production anymore, so programmers can apply them more liberally, leading to more robust software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the proposed schema, when a library is published, two packages should be generated: the 'Develop' package, for developing software that uses the library, and the 'Release' package, for shipping to production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of Java made it so that the generation of code within an &lt;code&gt;if()&lt;/code&gt; statement controlled by a compile-time constant is suppressed if that constant evaluates to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, but they intentionally deprived developers from the ability to specify the value of a compile-time constant via external means, such as the command-line of the compiler. They defended this choice by saying that there is inherent merit in being able to guarantee that in Java every compilation unit has one and only one set of semantics. The usefulness of this merit is debatable. It can be argued that this is simply Java treating developers the same way that Apple has been treating users: as idiots.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In C# most optimizations are performed by the Just-In-Time compiler (JITter), and people say that the optimizations performed by the language compiler do not make much of a difference. However, my experiments have shown otherwise: computation-intensive code tends to run twice as fast when optimizations are enabled than when not, and this difference can be observed on a build server, so it is unaffected by any optimization choices that the JITter might make due to a debugger being attached or not. I suspect that this is happening because the language compiler saves the &amp;quot;optimize&amp;quot; flag in the binary, and the JITter subsequently observes this flag.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink"&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A software testing tool is presented, which uses &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dependency analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to greatly optimize the process of running tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Useful pre-reading: &lt;a

&gt;About these papers&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-testana"&gt;What is Testana?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testana is a console application that you launch when you want to run your tests. So far, I have created two implementations of Testana:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Java implementation, supporting JUnit 4 annotations in Maven-based projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A C# implementation, supporting MSTest attributes in MSBuild solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-does-testana-achieve-that-existing-tools-do-not"&gt;What does Testana achieve that existing tools do not?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;runs only the subset of test modules that actually need to run&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, based on the last successful run time of each test module, and whether it, or any of its dependencies, have changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always considers all test modules in your entire code base as candidates for running&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, so you never have to manually select a subset of the tests to run in the interest of saving time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;runs test modules by order of dependency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that tests of modules that have no dependencies run first, tests of modules that depend on those run next, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;runs test methods in Natural Method Order,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; which is the order in which the methods appear in the source file. (This is the norm in C#, but not in Java, where extra measures are necessary to accomplish.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;runs test methods in ascending order of inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that test methods in the base-most test class run first, and test methods in derived test classes run afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;discovers and reports mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the formulation of test methods, instead of ignoring the mistakes, which is what most other test frameworks do. (Silent failure.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;does not catch any exceptions when debugging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, thus allowing your debugger to stop on the source line that threw the exception. (Testana will catch and report exceptions when not debugging, as the case is when running on a continuous build server.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-does-testana-work"&gt;How does Testana work?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testana begins by constructing the dependency graph of your software system. Since this process is expensive, Testana cashes the dependency graph in a file, and recalculates it only when the structure of the system changes. The cache is stored in a text file, which is located at the root of the source tree, and is meant to be excluded from source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana locates the modules that depend on nothing else within the system, and runs the tests of those modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once these tests are done, Testana finds modules that depend only on modules that have already been tested, and runs their tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testana keeps repeating the previous step, until all tests have been run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testana keeps a diary where it records the last successful run time of each test module. This diary is also stored in a text file, which is also located
at the root of the source tree, and is also meant to be excluded from source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time Testana runs, it considers the last successful run time of each test module, versus the last modification time of that module and its dependencies. Testana then refrains from running the test module if neither it, nor any of its dependencies, have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-should-i-care-about-running-only-the-tests-that-need-to-run"&gt;Why should I care about running only the tests that need to run?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual situation with large code bases is that tests take an unreasonably long time to run, so developers tend to take shortcuts in running them. One approach some developers take is that they simply commit code without running any tests, leaving it up to the continuous build server to run the tests and notify them of any test failures. This has multiple disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It causes repeated interruptions in the workflow, due to the slow turnaround of the continuous build, which is often of the order of an hour, sometimes longer, and even in the fastest cases, always longer than a normal person's attention span. (This is so by definition; if it was not, then there would be no problem with quickly running all tests locally before committing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The failed tests require additional commits to fix, and each commit requires a meaningful commit message, which increases the overall level of bureaucracy in the development process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commit history becomes bloated with commits that were done in vain and should never be checked out because they contain bugs that are fixed in later commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Untested commits that contain bugs are regularly being made to branches in the repository; these bugs stay there while the continuous build does its thing; eventually the tests fail, the developers take notice, and commit fixes. This whole process takes time, during which other unsuspecting developers might pull from those branches, thus receiving the bugs. Kind of like &lt;em&gt;Continuous Infection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testana solves the above problems by figuring out which tests need to run based on what has changed, and only running those tests. This cuts down the time it takes to run tests to a tiny fraction of what it is when blindly running all tests, which means that running the tests now becomes piece of cake and can usually be done real quick before committing, as it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, running the tests real quick right after each pull from source control now becomes feasible, so a developer can avoid starting to work on source code on which the tests are failing. (How often have you found yourself in a situation where you pull from source control, change something, run the tests, the tests fail, and you are now wondering whether they fail due to the changes you just made, or due to changes you pulled from the repository?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-should-i-care-about-considering-all-test-modules-in-my-entire-code-base-as-candidates-for-running"&gt;Why should I care about considering all test modules in my entire code base as candidates for running?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another approach taken by some developers, in the interest of saving time, is manually choosing which tests to run, based on their knowledge of what may have been affected by the changes they just made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One simple reason why this is problematic is that it requires cognitive effort to figure out which tests might need running, and manual work to launch them individually; it is not as easy as pressing a single button that stands for &amp;quot;run whatever tests need to run in response to the changes I just made.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A far bigger problem is that in manually selecting the tests to run, the developer is making assumptions about the dependencies of the code that they have modified. In complex systems, dependency graphs can be difficult to grasp, and as systems evolve, the dependencies keep changing. This often leads to situations where no single developer in the house has a complete grasp of the dependency graph of the entire system. Unfortunately, unknown or not-fully-understood dependencies are a major source of bugs, and yet by hand-selecting what to test based on our assumptions about the dependencies, it is precisely the not-fully-understood dependencies that are likely to not be tested. This is a recipe for disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testana solves the above problems by always considering all test modules as candidates for running. It does not hurt to do that, because the tests that do not actually need to run will not be run by Testana anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-should-i-care-about-running-test-modules-in-order-of-dependency"&gt;Why should I care about running test modules in order of dependency?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing test frameworks do not do anything intelligent in the direction of automatically figuring out some order of test execution that has any purpose or merit. The order tends to be arbitrary, and not configurable. In the best case it is alphabetic, but this is still problematic, because our criteria for naming test modules usually have nothing to do with the order in which we would like to see them executing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it is very common for a code base to contain a module called &amp;quot;Utilities&amp;quot;, which most other modules depend on; Since it is a highly dependent-upon module, it should be tested first, but since its name begins with a &amp;quot;U&amp;quot;, it tends to be tested last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testana executes test modules in order of dependency. This means that modules with no dependencies are tested first, modules that depend upon them are tested next, and so on until everything has been tested. Thus, the first test failure is guaranteed to point at the most fundamental problem; there is no need to look further down in case some other test failure indicates a more fundamental problem. Subsequently, Testana stops executing tests after the first failure, so it saves even more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about this way of testing, see &lt;a
href="https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2022-10-incremental-integration-testing/"
&gt;Incremental Integration Testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-should-i-care-about-running-test-methods-in-natural-order"&gt;Why should I care about running test methods in natural order?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test frameworks in the C# world tend to run test methods in natural order, which is great, but in the Java world, the JUnit framework runs test methods in random order, which is at best useless, and arguably treacherous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for wanting the test methods to run in the order in which they appear in the source file is because we usually test fundamental operations of our software before we test operations that depend upon them. (Note: it is the operations of the components under test that depend upon each other, not the tests themselves that depend upon each other!) So, if a fundamental operation fails, we want that to be the very first error that gets reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests of operations that rely upon an operation whose test has failed might as well be skipped, because they can all be expected to fail. Reporting those failures before the failure of the more fundamental operation is an act of sabotage against the developer, because it is sending us looking for problems in places where there are no problems to be found, and it is making it more difficult for us to locate the real problem, which typically lies in the test that failed first &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in the source file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example, suppose I am developing some kind of data store with insert and find functionality, and I am writing tests to make sure this functionality works. The find-item-in-store test necessarily involves insertion before finding, so I am likely to precede it with an insert-item-to-store test. In such a scenario, it is counter-productive to be told that my find-item-in-store test failed, sending me to troubleshoot the find function, and only later to be told that my insert-item-to-store test failed, which obviously means that it was in fact the insert function that needed troubleshooting; if insert-item-to-store fails, it is game over; no other operation on this store can possibly succeed, so there is no point in running any other tests on it, just as there is no point in beating a dead horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, another very simple, very straightforward, and very important reason for wanting the test methods to be executed in natural order is because seeing the test methods listed in any other order is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;brainfuck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related rant can be found here: &lt;a
href="https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2018-04-random-order-of-tests/"
&gt;On JUnit's random order of test method execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="why-should-i-care-for-running-test-methods-in-ascending-order-of-inheritance"&gt;Why should I care for running test methods in ascending order of inheritance?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feature of Testana might be irrelevant to you if you never use inheritance in test classes, but I do, and I consider it very important. I also consider the typical behavior of existing test frameworks on this matter very annoying, because they tend to do the exact opposite of what is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inheritance in test classes can help to achieve great code coverage while reducing the total amount of test code. Suppose you have a collection hierarchy to test: you have an ArrayList class and a HashSet class, and you also have their corresponding test classes: ArrayListTest and HashSetTest. Now, both ArrayList and HashSet inherit from Collection, which means that lots of tests are going to be identical between ArrayListTest and HashSetTest. One way to eliminate duplication is to have a CollectionTest abstract base class, which tests only Collection methods, and then have both ArrayListTest and HashSetTest inherit from CollectionTest and provide additional tests for functionality that is specific to ArrayList and HashSet respectively. Under this scenario, when ArrayListTest or HashSetTest runs, we want the methods of CollectionTest to be executed first, because they are testing the fundamental (more general) functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the example more specific, CollectionTest is likely to add an item to the collection and then check whether the collection contains the item. If this test fails, there is absolutely no point in proceeding with tests of ArrayListTest which will, for example, add multiple items to the collection and check to make sure that IndexOf() returns the right results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, existing test frameworks tend to handle this in a way which is exactly the opposite of what we would want: they execute the descendant (more specialized) methods first, and the ancestor (more general) methods last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testana corrects this by executing ancestor methods first, descendant methods last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-additional-error-checking-does-testana-perform"&gt;What additional error checking does Testana perform?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While running tests, Testana will warn the programmer if it discovers any method that has been declared as a test method but fails to meet the requirements for a test method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, test frameworks require that a test method must be a public instance method, must accept no parameters, and must return nothing; however, when these frameworks encounter a method that is declared as a test and yet fails to meet those requirements, (for example, a test method declared static,) they fail to report the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testana does not fail to report such mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="can-testana-be-fooled-by-inversion-of-control"&gt;Can Testana be fooled by Inversion of Control?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. In a scenario where class A receives and invokes interface I without having a dependency on class B which implements I, the test of A still has to instantiate both A and B in order to supply A with the I interface of B, so the test depends on both A and B, which means that Testana will run the test if there is a change in either A or B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="can-testana-be-fooled-by-the-use-of-mocks"&gt;Can Testana be fooled by the use of mocks?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Testana can be fooled by mocks, because that is what mocks do: they make a mockery out of the software testing process. In a scenario where class A receives and invokes interface I without having a dependency on class B which implements I, and the test of A also refrains from depending on B by just mocking I, Testana will of course not run the test of A when there is a change in B. This, however, should not be a problem, because you should not be using mocks anyway; for more information, see &lt;a
href="https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2023-01-14-mocking/"
&gt;If you are using mock objects you are doing it wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="can-testana-be-fooled-by-the-use-of-fakes"&gt;Can Testana be fooled by the use of fakes?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, as long as you do your testing properly. A test that utilizes a fake will be run by Testana only when there is a change in the fake, not when there is a change in the real thing; however, you should have a separate test which ensures that the behavior of the fake is identical to the behavior of the real thing in all aspects that matter. This test will be run by Testana when you modify either the fake, or the real thing, or both. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make a breaking change to the real thing, then your tests will show you that you need to make the corresponding change to the fake; the change in the fake will in turn cause Testana to run the tests that utilize the fake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make a non-breaking change to the real thing, then the fake will remain unchanged, and this is what gives you the luxury of not having to re-run tests utilizing the fake when you make a change that only affects the real thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="what-about-undiscoverable-dependencies-due-to-weak-typing-the-use-of-rest-etc"&gt;What about undiscoverable dependencies due to weak typing, the use of REST, etc?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following &amp;quot;hip&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;trendy&amp;quot; practices of the modern day are not supported by Testana, and there is no plan to ever support them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squandering dependencies via &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;weak typing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obscuring dependencies via &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;duck-typing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denaturing dependencies via &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stringly-typing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disavowing dependencies via &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;configuration files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abnegating dependencies via &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-programmatic interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; such as REST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragmenting dependencies via &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cross-language invocations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (following the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;polyglot craze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, stop all this fuckery and use a single, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; programming language, (that is, a programming language with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strong typing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,) encode your dependencies via the type system, and everything will be fine.

&lt;h3 id="how-compatible-is-testana-with-what-i-already-have"&gt;How compatible is Testana with what I already have?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Java implementation of Testana:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works with maven projects (pom.xml files.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports JUnit 4.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports only the basic, minimum viable subset of JUnit 4 functionality, namely the @Test, @Before, @After, and @Ignore annotations, without any parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The C# implementation of Testana:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works with MSBuild projects (.sln and .csproj files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports MSTest.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports only the basic, minimum viable subset of MSTest functionality, namely the [TestClass], [TestMethod], [ClassInitialize], [ClassCleanup], and [Ignore] attributes, without any parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for more languages, more project formats, more test frameworks, and more functionality may be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-is-it-like-using-testana"&gt;How is it like using Testana?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You run Testana every time you want to run your tests. You launch it at the root of your source tree, without any command-line arguments, and its default behavior is to figure out everything by itself and do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the first time you run Testana, there may be a noticeable delay while information is being collected; the information is cached, so this delay will not be there next time you run Testana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you run Testana, it will run all tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you immediately re-run Testana, it will not run any tests, because nothing will have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you touch one of your source files, build your project, and re-run Testana, it will only run tests that either directly or indirectly depend on the
changed file. If you run Testana with --help it will give you a rundown of the command-line arguments it supports.&lt;/p&gt;

Testana optimizes the testing process deterministically, so there is no need to resort to heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mechanism is described for automatically converting method invocations of any programmatic interface into a single-method &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;normal form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and converting back to invocations of the original interface, so that general-purpose operations can be performed on the normal form without explicit knowledge of the interface being invoked. Implementations are provided for C# and for Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Useful pre-reading: &lt;a
href="https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2022-11-about-these-papers/"
&gt;About these papers&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating software systems of nontrivial complexity we often need to be able to apply certain operations on the invocations that are being made between certain components. Examples of such operations are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging:&lt;/strong&gt; Recording information about each invocation being made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multicasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Delivering a single invocation to multiple recipients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remoting:&lt;/strong&gt; Placing invocations across machine boundaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desynchronization:&lt;/strong&gt; Queuing invocations for later execution, possibly on a different thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synchronization:&lt;/strong&gt; Obtaining and holding a lock for the duration of the invocation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transformation:&lt;/strong&gt; Converting between invocation formats, e.g. method calls to REST and back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, the components doing the invocations are application-specific, and the interfaces between them are also application-specific, but the operators that we want to interject between them are general-purpose, so they need to remain agnostic of the application-specific details of the invocations, in a way analogous to how a general-purpose sorting algorithm is agnostic of the application-specific format of the data it sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we need some way of expressing application-specific invocations in a general-purpose form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prior-art"&gt;Prior Art
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messages and message-passing:&lt;/strong&gt; The mechanism historically used for expressing invocations in a general-purpose form is message-passing. Unfortunately, its use is laborious, and it floods systems with debilitating amounts of incidental complexity. For details, see &lt;a
href="https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2022-12-messages-and-message-passing/"
&gt;On messages and message-passing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parameterless lambdas:&lt;/strong&gt; Application-specific method calls can be wrapped inside parameterless lambdas, and since all parameterless lambdas look the same, they can be handled by general-purpose code which may for example add them to a queue, and later dequeue and invoke them.
Unfortunately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wrapping of each application-specific method call inside a parameterless lambda must happen at each call site, which is cumbersome and reveals details about the underlying invocation delivery mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The evaluation of the parameters that are passed to the application-specific method happens at the moment that the lambda makes the call, not at the moment that the lambda is constructed, which can lead to insidious bugs even if the evaluations have no side-effects. (And &lt;em&gt;woe to you on earth and sea&lt;/em&gt; if they do have side-effects.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parameterless lambda completely hides the values of the parameters that are being passed to the application-specific method, as well as the identity of the method being invoked. Thus, parameterless lambdas cannot be used in scenarios that require information about each call being made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Proxies:&lt;/strong&gt; Both in Java and in C# there exist mechanisms that can be used to convert application-specific invocations to a general-purpose form, but not the other way around. These are &lt;code&gt;java.lang.reflect.Proxy&lt;/code&gt; for Java, and various libraries like Castle's and LinFu for C#. The reverse operation can be achieved using reflection, but this involves a round-trip to native-land, which incurs a heavy performance penalty. Furthermore, these mechanisms suffer from additional issues, such as messing with exceptions, doing more work than necessary, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-solution"&gt;The Solution
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to perform general-purpose operations on application-specific invocations we need a mechanism for converting application-specific invocations into a general-purpose form and back, so that the operators can act upon the general-purpose form. What follows is a description of such a mechanism, which I call &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intertwine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intertwine introduces a general-purpose form for expressing invocations, which is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the normal form of invocations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and is represented by a single method of the following signature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MethodKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In C#, &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; would be a &lt;em&gt;delegate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Java, &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; would be a &lt;em&gt;single-method interface&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise known as a &lt;em&gt;functional interface&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method signature represents the fact that every conceivable interface method call can be fully described in terms of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A return value, of the common denominator type &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A unique key which identifies which method of the interface is being invoked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An array containing arguments, of the common denominator type &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the method identifier is &lt;code&gt;MethodKey&lt;/code&gt; in the Java implementation, but &lt;code&gt;int selector&lt;/code&gt; in the C# implementation. This is because the Java implementation was made a considerable time after the C# implementation, and is therefore a bit more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;MethodKey&lt;/code&gt; used in the Java implementation allows the caller and the callee to unambiguously identify methods even in situations where binary compatibility between the caller and the callee is not guaranteed, and therefore an integer method index does not necessarily refer to the same method on both the caller and the callee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Java implementation of intertwine provides efficient means of converting back and forth between a &lt;code&gt;MethodKey&lt;/code&gt; and any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reflection &amp;quot;Method&amp;quot; object of the method. (This is &lt;code&gt;java.lang.reflect.Method&lt;/code&gt; in Java, or &lt;code&gt;System.Reflection.MethodInfo&lt;/code&gt; in C#.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The string representation of the prototype of the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The zero-based method index of the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample code that follows was written for C#, so it uses an &lt;code&gt;int selector&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;MethodKey key&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For methods of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; return type the value returned by AnyCall is unspecified. (It will in all likelihood be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, but nobody should rely on this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value types (primitives) are boxed and unboxed as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain features such as the &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; parameters in C#, receive special handling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other features such as properties, indexers, virtual events, etc. are nothing but syntactic sugar which is implemented using regular method calls under the hood, so they require no special handling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the problem can now be restated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to convert any interface method invocation to an invocation of an AnyCall method, and how to convert back from an invocation of an AnyCall method to an invocation of the original interface method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, Intertwine introduces two new concepts: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entwiners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untwiners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Entwiner of interface &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a class which exposes (implements) interface &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and delegates to an instance of &lt;em&gt;AnyCall&lt;/em&gt;. It can also be thought of as a &lt;em&gt;normalizer&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;generalizer&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;multiplexer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Untwiner of interface &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a class which exposes an &lt;em&gt;AnyCall&lt;/em&gt; method and delegates to an instance of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It can also be thought of as a &lt;em&gt;denormalizer&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;specializer&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;demultiplexer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entwiner of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; does the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepts an instance of &lt;code&gt;Anycall&lt;/code&gt; as a constructor parameter and stores it in a &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;readonly&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implements each method of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as follows:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packs the parameters that were passed to the method into an array of &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, performing any boxing necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invokes anyCall passing it a key that uniquely identifies the method, and the array of parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns, possibly after unboxing, whatever was returned by the invocation of anyCall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The untwiner of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; performs the opposite and complementary operation of the entwiner, namely:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepts an instance of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as a constructor parameter and stores it in a &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;readonly&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implements the &lt;code&gt;anycall&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;Anycall&lt;/code&gt; interface as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses the supplied &lt;code&gt;MethodKey&lt;/code&gt; to determine which method of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is being invoked, and for each method it does the
following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpacks the parameters from the array of &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, performing any unboxing necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invokes the method of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, passing it the unpacked parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns, possibly after boxing, whatever was returned by the method, or &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; if the method was of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; return type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="a-hand-crafted-implementation"&gt;A hand-crafted implementation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we look at the automatic creation of entwiners and untwiners, let us take a look at an example of how we would implement an entwiner and untwiner for a certain interface if we were to do it by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us consider the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Moo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Boo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let us consider the following class implementing that interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FooImplementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Moo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;i: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Boo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;s: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;, b: &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then let us consider the following method which invokes the interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InvokeFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Moo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Boo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;fubar!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The InvokeFoo method can be directly hooked up to an instance of the implementing class in a completely conventional way as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Run1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FooImplementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InvokeFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an entwiner for our IFooable interface could be hand-crafted as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;EntwinerForFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anycall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anycall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Moo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Boo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas an untwiner for IFooable could be hand-crafted as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;UntwinerForFooable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Moo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Boo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InvalidOperationException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the above classes, we can now write the following piece of awesomeness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Run2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FooImplementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;untwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UntwinerForFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EntwinerForFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;untwiner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InvokeFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;Run2()&lt;/code&gt; has exactly the same end-result as &lt;code&gt;Run1()&lt;/code&gt;, but there is a big difference in what goes on under the hood: all outbound interface method calls from the &lt;code&gt;InvokeFoo&lt;/code&gt; function are now arriving at the entwiner, which converts them to &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; invocations, which are then forwarded to the untwiner, which converts them back to &lt;code&gt;IFooable&lt;/code&gt; calls, which are then forwarded to our &lt;code&gt;FooImplementation&lt;/code&gt; object. This means that if we wanted to, we could interject a chain of objects between the entwiner and the untwiner, each one of these objects implementing an &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; delegate and invoking another &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; delegate, thus enabling us to perform any conceivable operation upon those invocations without having any built-in knowledge of the &lt;code&gt;IFooable&lt;/code&gt; interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the complexity of the interface increases, and as additional subtleties come into the picture, such as parameters passed with ref or out, coding entwiners and untwiners by hand can become very tedious and error-prone, so, obviously, we would like to have it automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="automating-it-with-reflection"&gt;Automating it with reflection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to write a general-purpose untwiner that does its job using reflection, but reflection is slow, so the result is going to suffer performance-wise. For the sake of completeness, here is a possible implementation for a general-purpose reflecting untwiner using reflection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ReflectingUntwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//WARNING: SLOW AS MOLASSES&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Reflection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MethodInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Methodinfos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;twinee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Methodinfos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;twinee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetMethods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BindingFlags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BindingFlags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NonPublic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BindingFlags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Instance&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Methodinfos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Invoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that untwiner creation could be optimized by caching the MethodInfos of frequently used types, but that's not the problem; the real bottleneck is the &lt;code&gt;MethodInfo.Invoke()&lt;/code&gt; call. If you put a breakpoint on the target and examine the stack, you will see that between the &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; frame and the target frame there will be a managed-to-native transition and a native-to-managed transition, which is something to be avoided at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note: it is impossible to write a reflecting entwiner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="automating-it-with-intertwine"&gt;Automating it with Intertwine
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intertwine library will automatically generate for us a pair of optimally-performing entwiner and untwiner classes for any interface. These classes are generated at runtime, so no extra build step is needed. To accomplish this, the C# implementation of Intertwine generates MSIL and creates assemblies from it; the Java Implementation generates bytecode and creates classes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following method of the &lt;code&gt;Intertwine.Factory&lt;/code&gt; class creates an entwiner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NewEntwiner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;anycall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; we give the type of our interface, and for &lt;code&gt;anycall&lt;/code&gt; we give a delegate of ours that will be receiving calls. This method returns a reference to an implementation of our interface, provided by an Entwiner-derived class that has been dynamically generated specifically for our interface, and instantiated to work with the given &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; instance. For every call received through a method of our interface, this special entwiner will be marshalling the arguments and forwarding the call to our &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; delegate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following method of the &lt;code&gt;Intertwine.Factory&lt;/code&gt; class creates an untwiner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NewUntwiner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For target we give an implementation of our interface, and what we get is a reference to an &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; delegate implemented by an Untwiner-derived class that was dynamically generated specifically for our interface, and instantiated to work with the given target instance. For every call received through the &lt;code&gt;AnyCall&lt;/code&gt; delegate, this special untwiner will be unmarshalling the arguments and forwarding the call to the appropriate method of our target interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with the dynamically generated entwiners and untwiners we can now do the following epicness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Run3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FooImplementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;AnyCall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;untwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Intertwine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Factory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NewUntwiner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Intertwine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Factory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NewEntwiner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IFooable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;untwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InvokeFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;entwiner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual implementation of &lt;code&gt;Intertwine.Factory&lt;/code&gt; is pretty straightforward, so there is not much to talk about. As one might expect, the generated types are cached. A static factory method is generated with each generated type, for instantiating the type, so as to avoid having to call &lt;code&gt;Activator.CreateInstance()&lt;/code&gt;, because that method uses reflection. The static factory method is invoked using &lt;code&gt;Delegate.Invoke()&lt;/code&gt;, which does not use reflection. You will find the code-generating code choke-full of comments, explaining exactly what each emitted opcode does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="appendix-an-example-interface-multicasts-events-in-c"&gt;Appendix: An example: Interface multicasts (events) in C#
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are still with me you may be thinking that it is about time for a demonstration. What follows is not just an example, but actually a complete and useful application of intertwine which you may be able to start utilizing in your projects right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C# language has built-in support for multicasts (events) but only delegates can be used as event observers. There are many cases, however, where interfaces would be more suitable. Java does not even have built-in support for multicasts, so programmers generally have to write their own, using single-method (functional) interfaces. In either language, if you want to achieve multicasting on multi-method interfaces, you have to rewrite the multicasting code for every single method of every single interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ITableNotification&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RowInserted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RowDeleted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RowUpdated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And consider the following hypothetical (not actually possible) way of using it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ITableNotification&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tableNotificationEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tableNotificationEvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tableNotificationEvent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RowUpdated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above does not work because events in C# work only with delegates, not with interfaces. However, with Intertwine, the next best thing is actually possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-CSharp" data-lang="CSharp"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tableNotificationEventManager&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InterfaceEventManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ITableNotifcation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tableNotificationEventManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RegisterObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_observer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tableNotificationEventManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RowUpdated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach is self-explanatory, and the amount of code you have to write in order to use it is optimal; you do not need to deal with anything more than what is necessary, and if you ever add a notification, it will be a new interface method, so all existing implementations of that interface will automatically be flagged by the compiler as incomplete. With the help of Intertwine, this event manager is implemented in just 150 lines of code, including extensive comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-goal"&gt;The Goal
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to be able do do things like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&amp;lt;Button Content=&amp;#34;{StaticResource mySvgImage}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;... where mySvgImage somehow stands for a vector image that has somehow been obtained from an SVG file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution must not involve any proprietary, closed-source libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we want one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either directly include SVG files into our application as resources, or, if that is not possible, then:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an &amp;quot;asset pipeline&amp;quot; approach where our SVG files are automatically converted during build into some format which is suitable for inclusion as a resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WPF likes to do everything in its own idiomatic way, so vector graphics in WPF are specified using the following construct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&amp;lt;Canvas&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;Path Fill=&amp;#34;#FFE68619&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;Path.Data&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;PathGeometry Figures=&amp;#34;M8.564 1.289.2 16.256A.5.5 0 0 0 .636 17H17.364a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5.494.494 0 0 0-.064-.244L9.436 1.289a.5.5 0 0 0-.872 0ZM10 14.75a.25.25 0 0 1-.25.25H8.25A.25.25 0 0 1 8 14.75v-1.5A.25.25 0 0 1 8.25 13h1.5a.25.25 0 0 1 .25.25Zm0-3a.25.25 0 0 1-.25.25H8.25A.25.25 0 0 1 8 11.75v-6a.25.25 0 0 1 .25-.25h1.5a.25.25 0 0 1 .25.25Z&amp;#34; FillRule=&amp;#34;NonZero&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;/Path.Data&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;/Path&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;/Canvas&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this notation is very similar to SVG path notation, WPF has no built-in support for SVG. They do not list SVG in their list of supported image file formats. (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh868203%28v=win.10%29?#image-file-formats" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;) This is preposterous, but that's what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has added SVG support to UWP via the SvgImageSource class, (&lt;a class="external"

&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;) but they have not bothered doing the same for WPF, probably as part of their greater strategy to let WPF go gently into that good night, since UWP is their new big thing that everyone must now start using whether they like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, there exists something called &amp;quot;XAML Islands&amp;quot; which offers means of including UWP controls within WPF applications, (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2018/11/02/xaml-islands-a-deep-dive-part-1/" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44936073/773113" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;) but it looks very convoluted, and the result will probably be held together by shoestrings, so I am not going to research that approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-inkscape-approach"&gt;The Inkscape approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inkscape offers the ability to export SVG to something they call &amp;quot;xaml format&amp;quot;, and it can even do that from the command line (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://inkscape.org/doc/inkscape-man.html" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;), making it suitable for using in an asset pipeline, but this feature is extremely limited. As far as I can tell, Inkscape offers absolutely no options for controlling how the exporting will be done; it just creates files that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;Path.Data&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;/Path&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;/Canvas&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &amp;lt;/Canvas&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&amp;lt;/Viewbox&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the obvious problem of useless elements that should not be there, the main problem with these files is that they are just plain unusable, because XAML offers no means of including one XAML file from within another XAML file. The only file inclusion mechanism supported by XAML is resource dictionaries, but this file is not describing a resource dictionary, so it cannot be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go looking for answers on Stackoverflow you will find that people copy-paste the PathGeometry elements from Inkscape-generated XAML files into their own XAML files, and they find nothing retarded in what they are doing. Others suggest to take the XAML files generated by Inkscape and copy them to Blend, and then convert them to Path, because the more clicks the better, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to programmatically load Inkscape-generated XAML files using the following construct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;using (Stream stream = App.GetResourceStream(
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; new Uri(&amp;#34;pack://application:,,,/Resources/MySvgExportedAsXaml.xaml&amp;#34;)).Stream)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; object o = XamlReader.Load(stream);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;... but then it is unclear how to make objects created this way usable from within XAML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;punker76 (the main person behind MahApps) offers a way of programmatically creating an icon pack in his blog post titled &amp;quot;How to create a new IconPack with custom SVG Paths&amp;quot;. (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://jkarger.de/2019/04/02/how-to-create-a-new-iconpack-with-custom-svg-paths/" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;) Such an icon pack can then be conveniently used from within XAML. However, his solution is tied to MahApps, while I would prefer an independent solution, and it is still not clear how to make that work with an object obtained by invoking the XamlReader.Load method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the process already looks quite a bit convoluted, so that's where I stop researching the Inkscape approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Svg2Xaml (&lt;a class="external"

&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This project is hosted in codeplex, which is closing down in July of 2021, and the author does not seem to have moved his project elsewhere. Some guy called Stefan Mischke has forked it on github (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://github.com/smischke/svg2xaml" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;) and has made a nuget package out of it, (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Svg2Xaml/" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;) but the lack of support and documentation makes this very unpromising.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This just converts svg to xaml. It might be possible to use it at runtime to load svg resources and convert them to xaml paths, and then use some other mechanism to make these paths usable from within xaml, but the process seems convoluted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SVG rendering engine (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://svg.codeplex.com/" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is described as a WinForms solution, so whatever it does, it will not be directly usable from within XAML. I am listing it here because it might turn out to be useful, but I will not research it any further.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may have been an open-source project at some point a long time ago, but it looks like it has now become a commercial product (&lt;a class="external"

&lt;li&gt;The README.md file shows a XAML snippet that looks promising, but it also says &amp;quot;Requirement: Win2D&amp;quot; and contains a warning about Windows 10 Aniversary Update, and I have no clue what are the implications of these statements. Overall, the project looks perhaps a bit too simplistic. Only try if other avenues fail.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The author says &amp;quot;The SVG parser and render is still not complete, but it is in a state where it can read most 'simple' SVG files I have found online so far.&amp;quot; So, no time should be invested on this. See next entry, &amp;quot;dotnetprojects/SVGImage&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Initially forked from CodeProject: &amp;quot;SVGImage Control&amp;quot;; appears to be in active development, (last update 5 months ago.) Its README.md looks tacky, but it may work, and it even has a nuget package (&lt;a class="external"

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very old, abandoned project. Has no documentation. Uses org.w3c.dom.svg to convert to GDI GraphicsPath. Contains some incomplete code. Not worth looking at. This is what SharpVectors (see below) started out from.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-if-i-already-have-some-xaml-graphics"&gt;What if I already have some XAML graphics?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are already using some graphics that exist in XAML-only form, (for example, the MahApps icon packs,) and you would prefer to have all vector graphics expressed in a single format throughout your application, then you might want to perform a one-time conversion of your existing XAML graphics to SVG. This will also allow you to get rid of the MahApps icon packs, which are many megabytes large, while your application is presumably using only a tiny fraction of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simple graphics, I have found that XAML notation is identical to SVG notation, so simply pasting the XAML string (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;PathGeometry Figures=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) into the corresponding SVG string (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;path d=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) yields a valid SVG file that you can work with. Since this is a one-time-only operation, it is not too bad if it has to be done manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a need for more advanced conversions, it appears that there are no tools out there for converting XAML to SVG, but this might be useful: Stackoverflow: &amp;quot;Wpf InkCanvas save stokes as svg&amp;quot; (&lt;a class="external"
href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39300338/773113" target="_blank"
&gt;⬀&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="svg-validation"&gt;SVG Validation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you start generating SVG from other sources, you are bound to end up with invalid SVG files. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, Inkscape does not give the slightest indication that there is something wrong with an SVG file. If you give Inkscape an invalid file to load, it will silently fail and render nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To troubleshoot SVG issues, a somewhat decent SVG validator is &lt;a class="external"
href="https://validator.nu" target="_blank"
&gt;validator.nu&lt;/a&gt;. (At least it helped me find problems in one SVG file, and after I fixed it, Inkscape successfully loaded it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another validator, which though is a bit too verbose and a bit too strict, is the &lt;a class="external"
href="https://validator.w3.org/check" target="_blank"
&gt;W3C validator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also exists something called &amp;quot;SVG Sanitizer&amp;quot; at svg.enshrined.co.uk, written by some guy called Daryll Doyle, it is completely useless, do not waste any time with it. (You can take hint from the fact that it is written in PHP.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a blooper of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), not of the language itself: &lt;code&gt;Stack&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; derive from &lt;code&gt;ICollection&lt;/code&gt;, but not from &lt;code&gt;ICollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so they do not support the &lt;code&gt;Remove( T )&lt;/code&gt; method!

&lt;p&gt;When writing generic methods in C#, it is possible to use the 'where' keyword to specify constraints to the types that the generic parameters can take. Unfortunately, these constraints cannot be used for resolving overloaded methods. Case in point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you assign an enum to int, you have to cast it. That's good. When you assign an int to enum, you also have to cast it. That's also good. But if you assign zero to an enum, you don't have to cast it! Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, C# takes an approach which is far more friendly to novice programmers than its predecessors, C and C++ were. For example, in the case of switch statements, C# does not allow the old, error-prone style of C and C++ where you could simply fall through from one case statement to the following one; instead, at the end of each case statement C# requires either a break statement, or a goto statement to explicitly jump to another label. That's all very nice and dandy, except for one thing: C# requires a break or goto even at the last case statement of a switch statement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is rather a Microsoft Visual Studio blooper than a Microsoft C# blooper: When formatting source code, Visual Studio offers an &amp;quot;indent case contents&amp;quot; option, but you will only find it useful if you happen to have a crooked notion as to how switch statements should be formatted. The one and only normal form of formatting switch statements is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, you might disagree that my way of formatting switch statements is in any way 'normal'. So, in your case, let us agree on this: my way of formatting switch statements, whether you like it or not, is in perfect accordance to the way I format the rest of my code; and since Visual Studio allows me to precisely describe my coding style, it should also allow for a switch statement style that matches the rest of my code.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>C# Blooper №8: No warnings for conditions that are always true/false</title><link>https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2013-01-04-csharp-blooper-8-no-warnings-for-conditions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2013 10:51:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2013-01-04-csharp-blooper-8-no-warnings-for-conditions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Before reading any further, please read the disclaimer in the &lt;a

&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft C# compiler does not issue 'condition is always true' and 'condition is always false' warnings. Perhaps these warnings are not particularly meaningful in Java, which lacks conditional compilation directives, and therefore &lt;strong&gt;if( true )&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;if( false )&lt;/strong&gt; are the only means of achieving conditional compilation; but in C#, which has special conditional compilation directives, conditions which are always true or always false are invariably so by mistake; therefore, these warnings would indeed be meaningful, and useful.&lt;/p&gt;

href="https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2012-01-05-csharp-bloopers/"
&gt;C# Bloopers&lt;/a&gt; series of articles shows, the Microsoft C# compiler fails to issue many useful warnings which one would reasonably expect from a decent compiler of any language, and which are in fact readily and lavishly issued by Java compilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all these years that the Microsoft C# compiler has been maturing, one cannot help but postulate that there are ulterior motives behind this continued state of misery with respect to warnings. For lo and behold, it just so happens that the &amp;quot;Ultimate&amp;quot; (most feature-packed and most outrageously expensive) edition of Microsoft Visual Studio contains a &amp;quot;Code Analysis&amp;quot; feature, which is capable of issuing hundreds of different types of warnings, ranging from the pedantic to the arcane, and including most, if not all, of the missing warnings that I am discussing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, besides the fact that the Code Analysis feature comes at a considerable additional cost, it is also very cumbersome to use on a frequent basis, since it has been built as a separate product feature, instead of having been integrated into the compiler. For one thing, it is very slow. Another thing is that it is very spammy: we are talking about multiple warnings for every single line of code here, most of which are useless, and the first thing you need to do about them is to turn them off. And there are several dozen warnings to turn off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cumbersomeness makes the Code Analysis feature unsuitable for use in the instant builds which developers tend to perform every few minutes or so, and more suitable to use as a separate code-quality-assurance step to be performed once or twice during the entire development process of a product, or at best on nightly builds. Unfortunately, it is precisely on instant builds that the warnings I am talking about in these articles are most useful. Better yet, most of these warnings are useful in real-time, while typing the code, in the form of yellow curly underlines. For example, as a developer, I want to know that a parameter to a method I have just written goes unused before I even proceed to start coding the next method, because it most probably means that I forgot something or I did something wrong. This information is useful not tomorrow, not in a couple of months, but right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what has probably happened here is that the Microsoft C# compiler team was told by Microsoft's marketing department to intentionally cripple the C# compiler and make it less useful to all of us, by moving some of the functionality which rightfully belongs to it into some other module, so that their premium &amp;quot;Ultimate&amp;quot; product can have a raison d'être.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you that Balmer is behind this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>C# Blooper №7: No warnings about unused private methods</title><link>https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2012-11-10-csharp-blooper-7-no-warnings-about-unused/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2012 07:29:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2012-11-10-csharp-blooper-7-no-warnings-about-unused/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Before reading any further, please read the disclaimer in the &lt;a

&lt;p&gt;If you have a private method which is never used, you will not be given a warning about it by the Microsoft C# compiler. This means that your app will likely get shipped with unnecessary chunks of code in it, some of them possibly containing string literals that were never meant to make it out of the development environment, or even requiring libraries to be linked which were never meant to be required on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable identifier is, of course, only visible within the scope in which it is declared. This includes nested (child) scopes, but it does not include enclosing (parent) scopes. In C# however, once a variable identifier has been used in a scope, its name is &amp;quot;poisoned&amp;quot;, so it cannot be used in enclosing scopes. Take this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 1

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt; 7

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;10

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//error CS0136: A local variable named &amp;#39;o&amp;#39; cannot be declared in this scope because it would give a different meaning to &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;, which is already used in a &amp;#39;child&amp;#39; scope to denote something else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I am sorry, but in the above case the new variable named 'o' would most definitely *not* give a different meaning to the 'o' which was used in the child scope. It would, if it had been declared before the 'if' statement, but it wasn't. Luckily, if this &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; was to be removed from the language, it would not break any existing code. So, can we please have this fixed? Pretty please?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common mistake that programmers make is to forget to make use of a parameter to a method. This can lead to quite subtle bugs that are hard to track down and correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, other language compilers are kind enough to warn the programmer that a parameter is unused, and they also allow temporary suppression of the warning for the rare case when such lack of use is legitimate. But not so in Visual C#. If you forget to use a parameter in Visual C#, you will not know unless you run the &amp;quot;Code Analysis&amp;quot; tool on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;

&gt;C# Blooper №4: Lame/annoying variable scoping rules, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, this one is more of a confusing error message than an actual new blooper. What I am doing below is that I am declaring a field within a class, I am accessing that field from within a method, and further down within the same method I am declaring a new local variable with the same name as the field. Now, C# will not allow me to declare that local variable because it has the same name as the field, but that's not where I am receiving the error. Instead, the error is given when accessing the field. If you only read the first sentence of the error message, it does not make any sense at all. If you bother also reading the second sentence, it gives you a hint as to the real problem. Now, that's not very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you declare a member variable and you pre-initialize it at the same time, and then you try to re-initialize it within the constructor without ever making use of its original pre-initialized value, you receive no warning about the field having already been initialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that you may accidentally invoke complex initialization logic twice, unnecessarily wasting memory and clock cycles, and it may also lead to logic errors, if by any chance that initialization logic has side effects which are only meant to occur once. It may also confuse someone reading your code, (or even yourself looking at your code months later,) trying to figure out what's the purpose behind the seemingly repeated initialization, before the realization sinks in that it is simply redundant. Furthermore, if the re-initialization happens to differ from the pre-initialization, a good question arises, asking which one of the two was meant to be the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a pity, because the compiler could warn the programmer against this pitfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#34;r&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//to prevent Warning CS0649: Field is never assigned to, and will always have its default value null &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone might argue that this is behavior is fine because the member in question is guaranteed to contain its default value. First of all, a readonly member containing its default value is completely useless. (See &lt;a
href="https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2011-12-31-csharp-blooper-1-no-warnings-about/"
&gt;C# Blooper №1: No warnings about uninitialized readonly members&lt;/a&gt;) Secondly, if the compiler is to help the developer catch potential errors and write better code, this is not a valid excuse: a different strategy is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the programmer intends the member to contain its default value, then the programmer ought to explicitly state so. Failing to do so ought to imply intention to initialize the member later on, and certainly before any attempt is made to read the member. This way, the programmer can have it both ways: they can have members pre-initialized to their default values, and they can receive warnings when they fail to initialize members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also please note that the compiler is capable of detecting that the value with which a member is being explicitly initialized is the default value for the type of the member, and so it can refrain from emitting any additional code for the assignment; thus, there is no performance issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not get me wrong; C# is awesome. It is the language of my choice, even though I am pretty well versed in C++ and Java. That having been said, it cannot be denied that C# has its share of flaws, too. In this series of posts I am documenting some of them, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C# compiler is kind enough to give you a &amp;quot;field is never assigned to&amp;quot; warning if you forget to initialize a readonly member which is private or internal, or if the class in which it is being declared is internal. But if the class is public, and the readonly member is public, protected or protected internal, then no warning for you! Why, oh why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;//Blooper: no warning about field never assigned to. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a moment you might think &amp;quot;well, a descendant might initialize that member&amp;quot;, but that theory does not hold any water, for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal classes may also be subclassed, but the compiler does not fail to issue the warning in their case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sealed classes may not be subclassed, but the compiler fails to issue the warning in their case, as Test3 in the sample code demonstrates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The warning makes sense for the sake of the integrity of the base class regardless of what a derived class may or may not do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly but most importantly, the C# specification expressly prohibits a derived class from initializing a readonly member of a base class. You get Error CS0191: A readonly field cannot be assigned to (except in a constructor or a variable initializer) which, incidentally, is a little bit misleading, because you may be trying to assign the field from within a constructor, only it is the constructor of the wrong class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="external"
href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/03b5270t%28v=vs.71%29.aspx" target="_blank"
&gt;MSDN Documentation&lt;/a&gt; about this warning, the exhibited behavior is to be expected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiler Warning (level 4) CS0649:
Field 'field' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value 'value'
The compiler detected an uninitialized private or internal field declaration that is never assigned a value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted this question on StackOverflow, and Eric Lippert himself answered it. The short answer is that it is an oversight of the compiler, but &lt;a class="external"

&gt;the long answer is also quite interesting and worth reading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Intertwine: Normalizing Interface Invocations</title><link>https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2011-10-16-intertwine-normalizing-interface/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2011 18:42:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog2.michael.gr/post/2011-10-16-intertwine-normalizing-interface/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This post has been superseded by a new post in 2022.

&gt;Intertwine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a C# project that I did back in 2011. It consists of a (rather informal) white paper which describes the project, and a zip file containing the source code in the form of a Microsoft Visual Studio solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mechanism is proposed for converting (entwining) method call invocations of any interface to a general purpose single-method normal form, and converting back (untwining) from the normal form to interface invocations, so that operations can be performed on the normal form in a way agnostic to the interface being invoked. The normal form is a delegate in C# or a functional interface in Java, realized as &lt;code&gt;object AnyCall( int selector, object[] parameters )&lt;/code&gt;. A DotNet implementation is provided in C#, though the discussion also applies to Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the table of contents:&lt;/p&gt;
